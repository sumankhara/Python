       " 'pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\\n',\n",
       " 'gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\\n',\n",
       " 'little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\\n',\n",
       " 'this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\\n',\n",
       " 'and put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\\n',\n",

       " 'drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\\n',\n",
       " 'and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\\n',\n",
       " 'down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\\n',\n",

       " 'drunk quite so much!”\\n',\n",
       " 'Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\\n',\n",
       " 'and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\\n',\n",
       " 'was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\\n',\n",
       " 'one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\\n',\n",
       " 'Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\\n',\n",
       " 'of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\\n',\n",
       " 'can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\\n',\n",
       " 'Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\\n',\n",
       " 'and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\\n',\n",
       " 'seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\\n',\n",
       " 'again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\\n',\n",
       " '“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\\n',\n",

       " 'rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\\n',\n",
       " 'yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\\n',\n",
       " '_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\\n',\n",
       " 'that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\\n',\n",
       " 'one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\\n',\n",
       " 'when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\\n',\n",
       " 'sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\\n',\n",
       " '“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\\n',\n",
       " 'now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\\n',\n",
       " 'then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\\n',\n",
       " '“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\\n',\n",

       " 'And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\\n',\n",
       " 'making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\\n',\n",

       " 'but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\\n',\n",
       " 'from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\n',\n",
       " 'cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\\n',\n",
       " 'Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\\n',\n",

       " '“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\\n',\n",

       " '“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\\n',\n",
       " 'There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\\n',\n",

       " 'hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\\n',\n",
